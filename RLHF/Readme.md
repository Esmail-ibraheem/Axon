# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback:

- ##### Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm
- ##### Direct Preference Optimization algorithm
- ##### Supervised Fine-tuning 

**AI alignment:** A large language model typically is pretrained on a massive amount of data, for example the entire Wikipedia and billions of web pages. This gives the language model a vast ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù of information to complete any prompt in a reasonable way. However, to use an LLM as a chat assistant (for example ChatGPT) we want to force the language model to follow a particular style. For example, we may want the following: 

- Do not use offensive language 
- Do not use racist expressions 
- Answer questions using a particular style The goal of AI alignment is to align the model‚Äôs behavior with a desired behavior.

**Reinforcement Learning:** Reinforcement Learning is concerned with how an intelligent agent should take actions in an environment to maximize the cumulative reward.

**The RL setup:**

**Agent:** the cat 

**State:** the position of the cat (x, y) in the grid 

**Action:** at each position, the cat can move to one of the 4-directionally connected cells. If a move is invalid, the cell will not move and remain in the same position. Every time the cat makes a move, it results in a new state and a reward.

**Reward model:** 
- A move to another empty cell results in a reward of 0. 
- A move towards the broom, will result in a reward of -1. 
- A move towards the bathtub will result in a reward of -10 and the cat fainting (episode over). The cat will be respawned at the initial position again. 
- A move towards the meat will result in a reward of +100 

**Policy:** a policy rules how the agent selects the action to perform given the state it is in: $a_ùë° \sim \pi(\cdot | ùë†ùë°)$ The goal in RL is to select a policy that maximizes the expected return
