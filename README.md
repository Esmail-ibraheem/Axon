As usual, we will start with setting up the working environment and importing the packages and libraries we will work on within this notebook. In addition to the usual packages such as os and openai, we will import the panel package which is a Python package we'll use for a chatbot UI. Also, we will import the utils file which will have some helper function that can be used to define the products and more.
