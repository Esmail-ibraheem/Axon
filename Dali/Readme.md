First, we need to define What is a generative model? 

A generative model learns a probability distribution of the data set such that we can then sample from the distribution to create new instances of data. For example, if we have many pictures of cats and we train a generative model on it, we then sample from this distribution to create new images of cats.

Now what are Diffusion Models are generative models which have been gaining significant popularity in the past several years, and for good reason. A handful of seminal papers released in the 2020s _alone_ have shown the world what Diffusion models are capable of, such as beating [GANs] on image synthesis. Most recently, practitioners will have seen Diffusion Models used in [DALL-E 2](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-dall-e-2-actually-works/), OpenAI’s image generation model released last month.
