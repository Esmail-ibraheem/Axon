# [Diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)

First, we need to define What is a generative model? 

A generative model learns a probability distribution of the data set such that we can then sample from the distribution to create new instances of data. For example, if we have many pictures of cats and we train a generative model on it, we then sample from this distribution to create new images of cats.

Now what are Diffusion Models are generative models which have been gaining significant popularity in the past several years, and for good reason. A handful of seminal papers released in the 2020s _alone_ have shown the world what Diffusion models are capable of, such as beating [GANs] on image synthesis. Most recently, practitioners will have seen Diffusion Models used in [DALL-E 2](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-dall-e-2-actually-works/), OpenAI’s image generation model released last month.

### Diffusion Models — Introduction

Diffusion Models are **generative** models, meaning that they are used to generate data similar to the data on which they are trained. Fundamentally, Diffusion Models work by **destroying training data** through the successive addition of Gaussian noise, and then **learning to recover** the data by _reversing_ this noising process. After training, we can use the Diffusion Model to generate data by simply **passing randomly sampled noise through the learned denoising process.**

Diffusion models are inspired by **non-equilibrium thermodynamics**. They define a **Markov chain** of diffusion steps to slowly add random noise to data and then learn to reverse the diffusion process to construct desired data samples from the noise. Unlike **VAE or flow models**, diffusion models are learned with a fixed procedure and the latent variable has high dimensionality (same as the original data).

### Now get deeper into the diffusion models:

diffusion models consists of two processes as shown in the image below:
- Forward process (with red lines).
- Reverse process (with blue lines).
