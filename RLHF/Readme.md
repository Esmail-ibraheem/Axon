# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback:

- ##### Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm
- ##### Direct Preference Optimization algorithm
- ##### Supervised Fine-tuning 

**AI alignment:** A large language model typically is pretrained on a massive amount of data, for example the entire Wikipedia and billions of web pages. This gives the language model a vast “knowledge” of information to complete any prompt in a reasonable way. However, to use an LLM as a chat assistant (for example ChatGPT) we want to force the language model to follow a particular style. For example, we may want the following: 

- Do not use offensive language 
- Do not use racist expressions 
- Answer questions using a particular style The goal of AI alignment is to align the model’s behavior with a desired behavior.

**Reinforcement Learning:** Reinforcement Learning is concerned with how an intelligent agent should take actions in an environment to maximize the cumulative reward.

**The RL setup:**

**Agent:** the cat 

**State:** the position of the cat (x, y) in the grid 

**Action:** at each position, the cat can move to one of the 4-directionally connected cells. If a move is invalid, the cell will not move and remain in the same position. Every time the cat makes a move, it results in a new state and a reward. 

![rlgame](https://github.com/Esmail-ibraheem/Axon/assets/113830751/781fea3d-de78-46e3-bcd9-8f596d28da30)

**Reward model:** 
- A move to another empty cell results in a reward of 0. 
- A move towards the broom, will result in a reward of -1. 
- A move towards the bathtub will result in a reward of -10 and the cat fainting (episode over). The cat will be respawned at the initial position again. 
- A move towards the meat will result in a reward of +100 

**Policy:** a policy rules how the agent selects the action to perform given the state it is in: $a_𝑡 \sim \pi(\cdot | 𝑠𝑡)$ The goal in RL is to select a policy that maximizes the expected return

**The RL setup: connection to language models** 

**Agent:** the language model itself State: the prompt (input tokens) 

**Action:** which token is selected as the next token 

**Reward model:** the language model should be rewarded for generating “good responses” and should not receive any reward for generating “bad responses”. 

**Policy:** In the case of language models, the policy is the language model itself! Because it models the probability of the action space given the current state of the agent: $a_𝑡 \sim \pi(\cdot | 𝑠𝑡)$

## History: RLHF for decision making

## RLHF: Let’s take it step by step

Reinforcement learning from Human Feedback (also referenced as RL from human preferences) is a challenging concept because it involves a multiple-model training process and different stages of deployment. In this blog post, we’ll break down the training process into three core steps:

1. Pretraining a language model (LM),
2. gathering data and training 
3. a reward model, and
4. fine-tuning the LM with reinforcement learning.

![Pasted image 20240430122335](https://github.com/Esmail-ibraheem/Axon/assets/113830751/790eba4f-b02b-4d15-81a0-fad8ad958633)

Figure: A diagram illustrating the three steps of our method: (1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) reward model (RM) training, and (3) reinforcement learning via proximal policy optimization (PPO) on this reward model. Blue arrows indicate that this data is used to train one of our models. In Step 2, boxes A-D are samples from our models that get ranked by labelers. See Section 3 for more details on our method.

**Step 1:** Collect demonstration data, and train a supervised policy. Our labelers provide demon strations of the desired behavior on the input prompt distribution (see Section 3.2 for details on this distribution). We then fine-tune a pretrained GPT-3 model on this data using supervised learning. 

**Step 2:** Collect comparison data, and train a reward model. We collect a dataset of comparisons between model outputs, where labelers indicate which output they prefer for a given input. We then train a reward model to predict the human-preferred output. 

**Step 3:** Optimize a policy against the reward model using PPO. We use the output of the RM as a scalar reward. We fine-tune the supervised policy to optimize this reward using the PPO algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017). 

**Steps 2 and 3** can be iterated continuously; more comparison data is collected on the current best policy, which is used to train a new RM and then a new policy. In practice, most of our comparison data comes from our supervised policies, with some coming from our PPO policies.

### train models with three different techniques:

![rlhf3](https://github.com/Esmail-ibraheem/Axon/assets/113830751/b1932c86-b9cd-4bbb-ac73-e3e022f54bd5)

**Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**. We fine-tune GPT-3on our labeler demonstrations using supervised learning. We trained for 16 epochs, using a cosine learning rate decay, and residual dropout of 0.2. We do our final SFT model selection based on the RM score on the validation set. Similarly to Wu et al. (2021), we find that our SFT models overfit on validation loss after 1 epoch; however, we find that training for more epochs helps both the RM score and human preference ratings, despite this overfitting. 

#### 1. Language Model Pretraining:

![rlhf_step11](https://github.com/Esmail-ibraheem/Axon/assets/113830751/dc87e901-5467-4c1e-8091-5ff7efbfd223)
As a starting point RLHF use a language model that has already been pretrained with the classical pretraining objectives (see this [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train) for more details). OpenAI used a smaller version of GPT-3 for its first popular RLHF model, [InstructGPT](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/). In their shared papers, Anthropic used transformer models from 10 million to 52 billion parameters trained for this task. DeepMind has documented using up to their 280 billion parameter model [Gopher](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11446). It is likely that all these companies use much larger models in their RLHF-powered products.

This initial model _can_ also be fine-tuned on additional text or conditions, but does not necessarily need to be. For example, OpenAI fine-tuned on human-generated text that was “preferable” and Anthropic generated their initial LM for RLHF by distilling an original LM on context clues for their “helpful, honest, and harmless” criteria. These are both sources of what we refer to as expensive, _augmented_ data, but it is not a required technique to understand RLHF. Core to starting the RLHF process is having a _model that responds well to diverse instructions_.

In general, there is not a clear answer on “which model” is the best for the starting point of RLHF. This will be a common theme in this blog – the design space of options in RLHF training are not thoroughly explored.

Next, with a language model, one needs to generate data to train a **reward model**, which is how human preferences are integrated into the system

common training techniques in NLP:- Unsupervised sequence prediction- Data scraped from web- No single answer on “best” model size (examples in industry range 10B-280B parameters)

**Reward modeling (RM).** Starting from the SFT model with the final unembedding layer removed, we trained a model to take in a prompt and response, and output a scalar reward. In this paper we only use 6B RMs, as this saves a lot of compute, and we found that 175B RM training could be unstable and thus was less suitable to be used as the value function during RL (see Appendix C for more details). In Stiennon et al. (2020), the RM is trained on a dataset of comparisons between two model outputs on the same input. They use a cross-entropy loss, with the comparisons as labels—the difference in rewards represents the log odds that one response will be preferred to the other by a human labeler. In order to speed up comparison collection, we present labelers with anywhere between $K = 4 and K =9$ responses to rank. This produces K 2 comparisons for each prompt shown to a labeler. Since comparisons are very correlated within each labeling task, we found that if we simply shuffle the comparisons into one dataset, a single pass over the dataset caused the reward model to overfit.5 Instead, we train on all K 2 comparisons from each prompt as a single batch element. This is much more computationally efficient because it only requires a single forward pass of the RM for each completion (rather than K 2 forward passes for K completions) and, because it no longer overfits, it achieves much improved validation accuracy and log loss. Specifically, the loss function for the reward model is: $$loss(\theta) = \frac{1}{2K} E{(x, y_w, y_l) \sim D} \left[ \log\left( \sigma\left(r_{\theta}(x, y_w) - r_{\theta}(x, y_l)\right) \right) \right]$$ is the scalar output of the reward model for prompt x and completion y with parameters , $y_w$ is the preferred completion out of the pair of yw and $y_l$, and $D$ is the dataset of human comparisons.

#### 2. Reward Model Training:

![rlhf_step22](https://github.com/Esmail-ibraheem/Axon/assets/113830751/fee39892-9ac3-4177-88c7-fd78d6749d34)

Generating a reward model (RM, also referred to as a preference model) calibrated with human preferences is where the relatively new research in RLHF begins. The underlying goal is to get a model or system that takes in a sequence of text, and returns a scalar reward which should numerically represent the human preference. The system can be an end-to-end LM, or a modular system outputting a reward (e.g. a model ranks outputs, and the ranking is converted to reward). The output being a **scalar** **reward** is crucial for existing RL algorithms being integrated seamlessly later in the RLHF process.

These LMs for reward modeling can be both another fine-tuned LM or a LM trained from scratch on the preference data. For example, Anthropic has used a specialized method of fine-tuning to initialize these models after pretraining (preference model pretraining, PMP) because they found it to be more sample efficient than fine-tuning, but no one base model is considered the clear best choice for reward models.

The training dataset of prompt-generation pairs for the RM is generated by sampling a set of prompts from a predefined dataset (Anthropic’s data generated primarily with a chat tool on Amazon Mechanical Turk is [available](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf) on the Hub, and OpenAI used prompts submitted by users to the GPT API). The prompts are passed through the initial language model to generate new text.

Human annotators are used to rank the generated text outputs from the LM. One may initially think that humans should apply a scalar score directly to each piece of text in order to generate a reward model, but this is difficult to do in practice. The differing values of humans cause these scores to be uncalibrated and noisy. Instead, rankings are used to compare the outputs of multiple models and create a much better regularized dataset.

There are multiple methods for ranking the text. One method that has been successful is to have users compare generated text from two language models conditioned on the same prompt. By comparing model outputs in head-to-head matchups, an [Elo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) system can be used to generate a ranking of the models and outputs relative to each-other. These different methods of ranking are normalized into a scalar reward signal for training.

An interesting artifact of this process is that the successful RLHF systems to date have used reward language models with varying sizes relative to the text generation (e.g. OpenAI 175B LM, 6B reward model, Anthropic used LM and reward models from 10B to 52B, DeepMind uses 70B Chinchilla models for both LM and reward). An intuition would be that these preference models need to have similar capacity to understand the text given to them as a model would need in order to generate said text.

At this point in the RLHF system, we have an initial language model that can be used to generate text and a preference model that takes in any text and assigns it a score of how well humans perceive it. Next, we use **reinforcement learning (RL)** to optimize the original language model with respect to the reward model.

How to capture human sentiments in samples and curated text? What is the loss! **Goal:** get a model that maps input text → scalar reward

> We aim for our model to emulate human responses more realistically. While the transformer model typically selects tokens with the highest prediction probability, we avoid this approach as it yields robotic-sounding answers. Instead, we employ various decoding strategies such as Top-K, Nucleus, Temperature, Greedy, etc. In this project, I utilize temperature decoding, where adjusting the temperature constant affects token selection: lowering the constant favors tokens with higher probabilities, while raising it favors those with lower probabilities.

**Reinforcement learning (RL).** Once again following Stiennon et al. (2020), we fine-tuned the SFT model on our environment using PPO (Schulman et al., 2017). The environment is a bandit environment which presents a random customer prompt and expects a response to the prompt. Given the prompt and response, it produces a reward determined by the reward model and ends the episode. In addition, we add a per-token KL penalty from the SFT model at each token to mitigate over optimization of the reward model. The value function is initialized from the RM. We call these models “PPO.” 

We also experiment with mixing the pretraining gradients into the PPO gradients, in order to fix the performance regressions on public NLP datasets. We call these models “PPO-ptx.” We maximize the following combined objective function in RL training:

The KL reward coefficient, , and the pretraining loss coefficient, , control the strength of the KL penalty and pretraining gradients respectively. For "PPO" models, is set to 0. Unless otherwise specified, in this paper InstructGPT refers to the PPO-ptx models.

#### 3. Fine-tuning with RL
![Pasted image 20240429132323](https://github.com/Esmail-ibraheem/Axon/assets/113830751/dd1de40b-e9d2-4058-9e89-9e07ff0800c6)

Training a language model with reinforcement learning was, for a long time, something that people would have thought as impossible both for engineering and algorithmic reasons. What multiple organizations seem to have gotten to work is fine-tuning some or all of the parameters of a **copy of the initial LM** with a policy-gradient RL algorithm, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Some parameters of the LM are frozen because fine-tuning an entire 10B or 100B+ parameter model is prohibitively expensive (for more, see Low-Rank Adaptation ([LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)) for LMs or the [Sparrow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14375) LM from DeepMind) -- depending on the scale of the model and infrastructure being used. The exact dynamics of how many parameters to freeze, or not, is considered an open research problem. PPO has been around for a relatively long time – there are [tons](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ppo.html) of [guides](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-ppo) on how it works. The relative maturity of this method made it a favorable choice for scaling up to the new application of distributed training for RLHF. It turns out that many of the core RL advancements to do RLHF have been figuring out how to update such a large model with a familiar algorithm (more on that later).

Let's first formulate this fine-tuning task as a RL problem. First, the **policy** is a language model that takes in a prompt and returns a sequence of text (or just probability distributions over text). The **action space** of this policy is all the tokens corresponding to the vocabulary of the language model (often on the order of 50k tokens) and the **observation space** is the distribution of possible input token sequences, which is also quite large given previous uses of RL (the dimension is approximately the size of vocabulary ^ length of the input token sequence). The **reward function** is a combination of the preference model and a constraint on policy shift.

The reward function is where the system combines all of the models we have discussed into one RLHF process. Given a prompt, _x_, from the dataset, the text _y_ is generated by the current iteration of the fine-tuned policy. Concatenated with the original prompt, that text is passed to the preference model, which returns a scalar notion of “preferability”, 𝑟𝜃rθ​. In addition, per-token probability distributions from the RL policy are compared to the ones from the initial model to compute a penalty on the difference between them. In multiple papers from OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind, this penalty has been designed as a scaled version of the Kullback–Leibler [(KL) divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between these sequences of distributions over tokens, 𝑟KLrKL​. The KL divergence term penalizes the RL policy from moving substantially away from the initial pretrained model with each training batch, which can be useful to make sure the model outputs reasonably coherent text snippets. Without this penalty the optimization can start to generate text that is gibberish but fools the reward model to give a high reward. In practice, the KL divergence is approximated via sampling from both distributions (explained by John Schulman [here](http://joschu.net/blog/kl-approx.html)). The final reward sent to the RL update rule is $r=r_θ​−λr_{KL}$

Some RLHF systems have added additional terms to the reward function. For example, OpenAI experimented successfully on InstructGPT by mixing in additional pre-training gradients (from the human annotation set) into the update rule for PPO. It is likely as RLHF is further investigated, the formulation of this reward function will continue to evolve.

Finally, the **update rule** is the parameter update from PPO that maximizes the reward metrics in the current batch of data (PPO is on-policy, which means the parameters are only updated with the current batch of prompt-generation pairs). PPO is a trust region optimization algorithm that uses constraints on the gradient to ensure the update step does not destabilize the learning process. DeepMind used a similar reward setup for Gopher but used [synchronous advantage actor-critic](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/mniha16.html?ref=https://githubhelp.com) (A2C) to optimize the gradients, which is notably different but has not been reproduced externally.

_Technical detail note: The above diagram makes it look like both models generate different responses for the same prompt, but what really happens is that the RL policy generates text, and that text is fed into the initial model to produce its relative probabilities for the KL penalty. This initial model is untouched by gradient updates during training_.

Optionally, RLHF can continue from this point by iteratively updating the reward model and the policy together. As the RL policy updates, users can continue ranking these outputs versus the model's earlier versions. Most papers have yet to discuss implementing this operation, as the deployment mode needed to collect this type of data only works for dialogue agents with access to an engaged user base. Anthropic discusses this option as _Iterated Online RLHF_ (see the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05862)), where iterations of the policy are included in the ELO ranking system across models. This introduces complex dynamics of the policy and reward model evolving, which represents a complex and open research question.

Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence: $D_{KL}(P || Q)$ Distance between distributions

Constrains the RL fine-tuning to not result in a LM that outputs gibberish (to fool the reward model). Note: DeepMind did this in RL Loss (not reward), see GopherCite

#### 3.1. Fine-tuning with RL - PPO

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)- on-policy algorithm,- works with discrete or continuous actions,- optimized for parallelization.

If we apply the “PPO” like described, the language model (our policy) may just learn to output whatever the reward model wants to see to maximize its return. We for sure want the language model to receive good rewards, but as the same time we want the language model to output something that still looks like the training data it was trained upon. For this reason, for every reward generated by the model, we penalize the reward by the KL-Divergence between the logits generated by the policy being optimized and a frozen version of the language model.

**Baselines**. We compare the performance of our PPO models to our SFT models and GPT-3. We also compare to GPT-3 when it is provided a few-shot prefix to ‘prompt’ it into an instruction-following mode (GPT-3-prompted). This prefix is prepended to the user-specified instruction.6 We additionally compare InstructGPT to fine-tuning 175B GPT-3 on the FLAN (Wei et al., 2021) and T0 (Sanh et al., 2021) datasets, which both consist of a variety of NLP tasks, combined with natural language instructions for each task (the datasets differ in the NLP datasets included, and the style of instructions used). We fine-tune them on approximately 1 million examples respectively and choose the checkpoint which obtains the highest reward model score on the validation set. See Appendix C for more training details.
