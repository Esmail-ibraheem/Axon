# attention is all you need

### Transformers:

**Abstract.** The Transformer neural network is a powerful deep learning model that was introduced in a landmark paper titled **"attention is all you need"** by Vaswani et al. in 2017. It revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and has since found applications in various other domains. The Transformer architecture is based on the concept of attention, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks.
The transformer is a neural network component that can be used to learn useful represen tations of sequences or sets of data-points [Vaswani et al., 2017]. The transformer has driven recent advances in natural language processing [Devlin et al., 2019], computer vision [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021], and spatio-temporal modelling [Bi et al., 2022].
