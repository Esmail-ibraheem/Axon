Welcome to **Axon: AI Research Lab!** This repository serves as a collaborative platform for implementing cutting-edge AI research papers and conducting novel research in various areas of artificial intelligence. Our mission is to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical applications by providing high-quality, reproducible implementations of seminal and contemporary AI papers: InstructGPT, llama, transformers, diffusion models, RLHF, etc...
 
---

## Papers implemented:
- attention is all you need.
- InstructGPT.
- Llama.
- Multi-Head attention.
- Multi-Query attention.
- Grouped-Query attention.
- reinforcement learning from human feedback.
